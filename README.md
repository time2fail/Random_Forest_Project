# Random Forest Project

This repository contains a Random Forest classification project implemented in Python.  
The goal is to explore data, visualize relationships, and build a Random Forest model to predict whether a loan will be fully paid or not.

## üìå Project Overview
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the dataset.  
- Visualize distributions (pie charts, histograms, scatter plots, count plots with percentages).  
- Preprocess the dataset (handle categorical/numerical features).  
- Train a **Random Forest classifier**.  
- Evaluate the model with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries:  
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - matplotlib  
  - seaborn  
  - scikit-learn

## üìä Dataset
The dataset used in this project was provided as part of a Udemy course for educational purposes.  
‚ö†Ô∏è For this reason, the raw dataset file is **not included in this repository**.  

If you are following along with the same course, you should already have access to the dataset.  
Otherwise, you can replace it with any dataset that has a similar structure (categorical + numerical features suitable for classification).

## üìä Visualizations
Some of the visualizations included:  
- Loan purpose distribution (pie chart)  
- Interest rate distribution (histogram with KDE)  
- Relationship between FICO score and interest rate (scatter plot with regression line)  
- Loan purpose vs repayment status (count plot with percentages)
